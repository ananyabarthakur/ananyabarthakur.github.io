     <caption> <p>The Office is a TV series that depicts the daily work lives of employees in an American workplace. I started watching the office in my junior year of highschool, and it didn’t take long for it to become my favorite sitcom of all time. With over 42 Emmy nominations, this show has humor, a solid storyline, and relatable characters. I have watched the entire show well over 7 times, with each time getting funnier as I grow to see the subtle comedic elements. I think this show stands out as it’s mockumentary style and distinct characters make the perfect mix of humor and awkwardness. This show has also offered many enduring memes and quotes to pop culture. It has many well written one-liner jokes, it’s a show that can be liked by people of all ages. This show has had a continuous success like no other sitcom and is something we can always turn to for comfort and laughter, at least I know I can!
